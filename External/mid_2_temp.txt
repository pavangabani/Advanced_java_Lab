//1. order of calls of methods in applet
	init
	start
	stop
	destroy

//2. when will exception handler InterupptedEcxeption be executed?
	when one thread is interuppted and goes to block state without terminating,and that thread when 
reschedule again at that time exception handler of InterruptedException executed.

//3. why sleep required to be native method?
	 To improve performance of the system.
          To achieve machine level/memory level communication.
          To use already existing legacy non-java code.

//4. explain by giving example how packages are usefull for resolving naming conflicts.
	packages means folders.as we can't have files with same name in same folder,but can have files with same name 
in different folder.same way we can't have classes with same name in 1 package but can have classes with same name in 
different package.

//5. arrange in order based on most liberal to most strict access specifier.
	public
	protected
	default
	private

//6. how do you decide whether implement runnable or to extend thread?
	if a class already extends another class then it can't extends Thread because multiple inheritance is not allowed 
in java.in that case we have to implement runnable interface.otherwise we can use both approaches.

//7. not correct for interface(multiple answer).
	a reference of interface can't be created

//8. write all steps for creating a GUI component for handling corresponding events.


//9.wait is a member method of Thread,why?


//10. write possible consequances of not using volatile keyword in multi-threaded program. 
The volatile modifier is used to let the JVM know that a thread accessing the variable must always merge
 its own private copy of the variable with the master copy in the memory. Accessing a volatile variable
 synchronizes all the cached copied of the variables in the main memory
